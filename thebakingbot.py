These can be useful for dissociation, anxiety, panic attacks, and flashbacks. You can try one, a few, or all of them.
    - Choose a letter of the alphabet and try and come up with as many examples of a category you choose as you can. For example, animals that start with D: dog, deer, dingo, donkey, etc. Or vegetables that start with C: cucumber, cauliflower, celery, etc.
    - Count backwards from 100 by 3s, 6s, or 7s.
    - Describe an every day event or process in great detail, listing all of the steps in order and as thoroughly as possible (e.g., how to cook a meal)
    - Say or think to yourself: "My name is (...). I am safe right now. I am (...) years old and currently at (place). The date is (...). If I need help, I can contact (...). Everything is going to be alright, I can handle this."
    - Name five things that you see, four that you can touch, three that you hear, and two that you smell or taste, and then one thing that you like about yourself.
    - Try this link <https://www.healthyplace.com/blogs/treatinganxiety/2010/09/top-21-anxiety-grounding-techniques/> or <http://did-research.org/treatment/grounding.html> for more.""",
    """Hey there, here are a few ideas to ground yourself.
These can be useful for dissociation, anxiety, panic attacks, and flashbacks. You can try one, a few, or all of them.
    - Touch and hold objects around you. Compare the feel, weight, temperature, textures, colors, and materials, describe them to yourself.
    - Squeeze a pillow, stuffed animal, or rubber ball, touch sandpaper (gently), sponges, denim, pop bubble wrap, rip up paper, run lukewarm water on your hands or splash your face with it (be careful).
    - Picture yourself breathing in relaxation/positive feelings/strength and breathing out negativity. You can also imagine you're breathing in soothing colors (blue, purple, green) and out intense colors (red, black).
    - Put your feet on the floor, gently squeeze or rub your legs and sit upright. 'Push' with your feet, almost as if you wanted to stand up, but do *not* stand up. Notice how your muscles work and how your body tenses.
    - If possible, crack a window and notice the cold air, the new sounds, and all the smells. Describe them to yourself.

    """Hey there, here are a few ideas to ground yourself.

    - Ask a friend for a reality-test. If you aren’t sure if something you’re feeling, seeing, hearing or thinking is real, ask a safe friend to help you decide what is fact, what is fiction, what is a flashback, and so on.
    - Do a few jumping jacks, sit-ups, or push-ups.
    - Try counting by 3's or 7's up to 200, then try multiplying by them.
    - Play with a tangle or a fidget cube. (Fidget spinners are not recommended!)
    - Remind yourself that extreme emotions, panic/anxiety attacks, flashbacks, or dissociation will go away just as they came. They cannot "hurt" you.
